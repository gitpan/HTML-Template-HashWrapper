HTML::Template::HashWrapper version 1.0
=======================================

HTML::Template::HashWrapper provides a simple way to use arbitrary hash
references (and hashref-based objects) with HTML::Template's
``associate`` option.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The test suite depends on Test::Exception.

The module itself has no dependencies (but is probably not very
interesting without HTML::Template).
